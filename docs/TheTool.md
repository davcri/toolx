# How to Create a Tool in ToolX

## Introduction to Tool Creation
Creating custom tools in ToolX allows for tailored solutions to specific file processing needs. Tools in ToolX have a defined structure and key methods that handle the processing logic.

## Understanding onEveryFile and onBody
- `onEveryFile`: This method is invoked for each file that the tool processes. It is where you can define the actions performed on individual files.
- `onBody`: This method is called after all files have been processed by `onEveryFile`. It is used for final processing steps or to compile results.

## The Significance of next()
- The `next()` function is crucial in managing the asynchronous flow of file processing. It ensures that the tool moves to the next file or step only after the current operation is complete.
- Proper use of `next()` is essential for maintaining order and efficiency in the processing pipeline.

## Defining File Extensions (exts)
- Specifying file extensions allows you to define which file types the tool will process. For instance, an image processing tool might only handle `.jpg` and `.png` files.
- This feature adds a layer of flexibility and control in tool customization.

## Code Example with Explanations
Below is an example of a custom ToolX tool with detailed comments:

```javascript
class CustomTool {
    // Constructor for initializing the tool
    constructor(options) {
        this.options = options;
        // Define the file extensions this tool will process
        this.exts = ['jpg', 'png'];
    }

    // Method called on before all files have been processed
    async onStart(pathIn, pathOut, options) {
        // File processing logic here
        // ...
    }


    // Method called for each file
    async onEveryFile(next, { file, options }) {
        // File processing logic here
        // ...

        // Call next() to move to the next file or processing step
        next(file);
    }

    // Method called after all files have been processed
    async onBody(next, { files, options }) {
        // Final processing logic or compilation of results
        // ...

        // Finalize the processing
        next();
    }
}

export default CustomTool;
```

This example illustrates the basic structure and key methods of a ToolX tool. The comments provide insights into each part of the tool's functionality.

## Conclusion
Understanding the architecture and flow of ToolX tools is vital for creating effective custom solutions. This guide aims to provide a foundational understanding, empowering developers to build their own tools within the ToolX ecosystem.
